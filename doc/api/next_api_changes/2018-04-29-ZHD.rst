Improved call signature for Axes.margins()
------------------------------------------

:meth:`matplotlib.axes.Axes.margins` and :meth:`mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.Axes3D.margins`
no longer accept arbitrary keywords.  ``TypeError`` will therefore be raised
if unknown kwargs are passed; previously they would be silently ignored.

If too many positional arguments are passed, ``TypeError`` will be raised
instead of ``ValueError``, for consistency with other call-signature violations.

``Axes3D.margins`` now raises ``TypeError`` instead of emitting a deprecation
warning if only two positional arguments are passed.  To supply only ``x`` and
``y`` margins, use keyword arguments.
