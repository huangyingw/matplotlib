Deprecations
````````````

When given 2D inputs with non-matching numbers of columns, `~.pyplot.plot`
currently cycles through the columns of the narrower input, until all the
columns of the wider input have been plotted.  This behavior is deprecated; in
the future, only broadcasting (1 column to *n* columns) will be performed.
